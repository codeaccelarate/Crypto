    <h2>Program Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        This program is a web-based application built using Flask that predicts cryptocurrency prices using LSTM neural networks. Here's a simplified breakdown:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The program uses the Binance API to retrieve historical price data of cryptocurrencies.</li>
        <li>It preprocesses the data by extracting closing prices and normalizing them using MinMaxScaler.</li>
        <li>The LSTM models (one for each cryptocurrency) are loaded with pre-trained weights.</li>
        <li>When a user makes a prediction request through the web interface, the appropriate model is used to predict future prices.</li>
        <li>Predictions are displayed along with real prices, percentage differences, and recommendations (buy, sell, hold) based on the prediction.</li>
        <li>The program also generates plots comparing predicted prices with real prices for visualization.</li>
        <li>The Flask framework enables the interaction through a user-friendly web interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        The code requires several libraries and tools to run successfully:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flask for the web application framework.</li>
        <li>Keras for building and training LSTM neural network models.</li>
        <li>pandas for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li>numpy for numerical computations.</li>
        <li>sklearn for data preprocessing (MinMaxScaler).</li>
        <li>matplotlib for generating plots.</li>
        <li>Binance API (`binance.client.Client`) for fetching historical cryptocurrency data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Data is Collected?</h2>
    <p>
        Data is collected using the Binance API (`binance.client.Client`). The code retrieves historical price data for specific cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple) within a given time range. The data is returned as a DataFrame and then used for further analysis and prediction.
    </p>

    <h2>How Data is Filtered?</h2>
    <p>
        The historical price data fetched from Binance API is filtered to extract specific features, mainly the closing prices (`'Close'` column). These closing prices are used as the basis for predicting future prices.
    </p>

    <h2>What Algorithms are Used?</h2>
    <p>
        The primary algorithm used in this program is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, implemented using Keras. LSTM networks are suitable for sequence prediction tasks, such as time series forecasting, which makes them ideal for predicting cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.
    </p>
        <h2>Module Explanations</h2>

<!-- Explanation for NumPy -->
<h3>1. numpy (import numpy as np)</h3>
<p>
    <strong>NumPy</strong> is a fundamental Python library that enables efficient numerical operations on large datasets. It provides a powerful array object and a collection of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, and selection functions.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key Features and Benefits:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-dimensional Arrays:</strong> NumPy's main feature is its <code>ndarray</code> (n-dimensional array) object, which allows efficient storage and manipulation of homogeneous data. This is crucial for representing and processing cryptocurrency data, which often involves multi-dimensional datasets such as historical price sequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Functions:</strong> NumPy provides a comprehensive suite of mathematical functions for operations like arithmetic, trigonometry, statistics, and linear algebra. These functions are essential for performing numerical computations on cryptocurrency data, such as calculating moving averages, correlation coefficients, or matrix operations in predictive modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency and Performance:</strong> NumPy's array operations are implemented in compiled C code, making them significantly faster than equivalent operations in pure Python. This efficiency is crucial for handling large-scale cryptocurrency datasets and conducting complex computations in real-time or during model training.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Besides arrays, NumPy offers tools for reshaping, indexing, and slicing data efficiently. These capabilities are valuable for preprocessing raw cryptocurrency data into formats suitable for machine learning models or for extracting specific features from the dataset.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<!-- Explanation for MinMaxScaler -->
<h3>2. sklearn (from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler)</h3>
<p>
    <strong>MinMaxScaler</strong> is a preprocessing technique used to scale numeric data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. This technique is important for ensuring that all features contribute equally to machine learning models, especially when the features have different scales or units.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Key Points:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> MinMaxScaler performs scaling by shifting and rescaling features to a given range, often [0, 1]. This is achieved through the formula: <code>X_scaled = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)</code>, where <code>X</code> is the original feature, <code>X_min</code> is the minimum value of <code>X</code>, and <code>X_max</code> is the maximum value of <code>X</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Normalization for ML Models:</strong> By scaling cryptocurrency prices using MinMaxScaler, we ensure that the price values are within a consistent range across different cryptocurrencies. This normalization aids in training machine learning models, such as regression models or neural networks, which can be sensitive to the scale of input features.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage in Predictive Models:</strong> In our project, MinMaxScaler is employed to preprocess cryptocurrency price data before feeding it into predictive models. Normalizing the price data helps improve model performance and stability during training and prediction phases.</li>
    </ul>

            <strong>Loading Pre-Trained Models:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The script loads pre-trained LSTM models (`btc_model`, `eth_model`, etc.) from saved files (`btc_model.h5`, `eth_model.h5`, etc.).</li>

            <strong>Prediction (`predict()`):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>When a prediction request is made (e.g., to predict Bitcoin's price for the next day), the appropriate LSTM model is selected based on the chosen cryptocurrency.</li>
                <li>The model is used to predict the future price based on historical price data.</li>
                <li>The predicted prices are then transformed back to their original scale to provide meaningful predictions.</li>
